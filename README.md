# Covid-19 Information App

This React capstone project is about building a mobile web application to check a list of metrics (numeric values) that you will create making use of React and Redux.

I chose the Covid-19 API to show the information currently affect a lot of people in the world. It displays information based on a country and users can search for a particular country as well as filter the dates to view information for a particular day.

# Biult with:
